A conditional statement is a type of **control statement**, in that it allows the programmer to control the logical \\`flow' of the program.

Functions help to make code reuseable, as well as making it more readable and easier to maintain.\n",

For example, `print()` expects an argument in the form of a string or variable, which it will then output to the console.\n",
